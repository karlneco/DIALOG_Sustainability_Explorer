<span class="dimension_name">Window U-Value</span><br/>
<div style="height: 280px; overflow: auto">
<p>
    The transmittance value of a window is indicated by its U value. The lower the U value the lower the
     heat loss through the surface. The units used are BTU/(hr ft2 °F), the metric equivalent is W/(m2K). 
     To convert between U and USI, use 1 (hr·ft2·°F)/Btu = 5.678263 K·m2/W . A window with U-value of 
     0.35 has a USI of approximately 1.99.
</p>
<p>
    The overall system U-value should be used here, not simply the center-of-glass U-value. The system 
    value includes the effects of the framing and the edge-of-glass effects.
