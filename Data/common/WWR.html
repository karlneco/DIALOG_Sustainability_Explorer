<span class="dimension_name">Window to Wall Ratio</span><br/><span style="font-size: 8px;">(Window Fraction)</span><br/>
<p>
    The window fraction parameter is the percent of the total, above grade wall surface that is made up of
    windows. Windows will generally have greater heat loss than walls so the more windows, the greater the 
    overall heat loss. However, windows also admit solar radiation offsetting heating loads, so a balance 
    is necessary. The following image demonstrates some window-to-wall ratios.
