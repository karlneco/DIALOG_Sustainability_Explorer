<span class="dimension_name">Roof R-Value</span><br/>
<p>
    The insulating value of a roof is indicated by its R value. The higher the R value the lower the heat 
    loss through the surface. The units used in are (hr·ft2·°F)/Btu, the metric equivalent is K·m2/W. To 
    convert between R and RSI, use 1 K·m2/W = 5.678 (hr·ft2·°F)/Btu. A roof with R-value of 30 has an RSI 
    of approximately 5.28.

    The value entered here should be the overall system value, not simply the nominal value of the 
    insulation layer in the wall assembly. The system value accounts for thermal bridging effects from 
    studs, shelf-angles, window-to-wall transitions, etc.
